# Outline
[TOC]

In this chapter, you will go through an example project end to end, pretending to be a recently hired data scientist in a real estate company.1 Here are the main steps you will go through:

```text
1. Look at the big picture.

2. Get the data.

3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.

4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.

5. Select a model and train it.

6. Fine-tune your model.

7. Present your solution.

8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
```

## Working with Real Data

When you are learning about Machine Learning it is best to actually experiment with real-world data, not just artificial datasets. Fortunately, there are thousands of open datasets to choose from, ranging across all sorts of domains. Here are a few places you can look to get data:

- Popular open data repositories:

	- [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)

	- [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

	- [Amazon’s AWS datasets](http://aws.amazon.com/fr/datasets/)

- Meta portals (they list open data repositories):
  - http://dataportals.org/
  - http://opendatamonitor.eu/
  - http://quandl.com/
- Other pages listing many popular open data repositories:
  - [Wikipedia’s list of Machine Learning datasets](https://goo.gl/SJHN2k)
  - [Quora.com question](http://goo.gl/zDR78y)
  - [Datasets subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets)

## Look at the Big Picture

### Frame the Problem

### Select a Performance Measure

###Check the Assumptions

## Get the Data

###Create the Workspace

### Download the Data

### Take a Quick Look at the Data Structure

### Create a Test Set

## Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights

### Visualizing Geographical Data

### Looking for Correlations

### Experimenting with Attribute Combinations

## Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms

###Data Cleaning

### Handling Text and Categorical Attributes

### Custom Transformers

### Feature Scaling

### Transformation Pipelines

## Select and Train a Model

At last! You framed the problem, you got the data and explored it, you sampled a training set and a test set, and you wrote transformation pipelines to clean up and prepare your data for Machine Learning algorithms automatically. You are now ready to select and train a Machine Learning model.

### Training and Evaluating on the Training Set

### Better Evaluation Using Cross-Validation

## Fine-Tune Your Model

### Grid Search

### Randomized Search

### Ensemble Methods

### Analyze the Best Models and Their Errors

### Evaluate Your System on the Test Set

## Launch, Monitor, and Maintain Your System
