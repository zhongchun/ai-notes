# Outline
[TOC]

In this chapter, you will go through an example project end to end, pretending to be a recently hired data scientist in a real estate company.1 Here are the main steps you will go through:

```text
1. Look at the big picture.

2. Get the data.

3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.

4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.

5. Select a model and train it.

6. Fine-tune your model.

7. Present your solution.

8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
```

## Working with Real Data

When you are learning about Machine Learning it is best to actually experiment with real-world data, not just artificial datasets. Fortunately, there are thousands of open datasets to choose from, ranging across all sorts of domains. Here are a few places you can look to get data:

- Popular open data repositories:

	- [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)

	- [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

	- [Amazon’s AWS datasets](http://aws.amazon.com/fr/datasets/)

- Meta portals (they list open data repositories):
  - http://dataportals.org/
  - http://opendatamonitor.eu/
  - http://quandl.com/
- Other pages listing many popular open data repositories:
  - [Wikipedia’s list of Machine Learning datasets](https://goo.gl/SJHN2k)
  - [Quora.com question](http://goo.gl/zDR78y)
  - [Datasets subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets)
