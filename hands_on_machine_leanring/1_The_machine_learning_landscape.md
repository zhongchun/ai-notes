# The Machine Learning Landscape

[TOC]

Where does Machine Learning start and where does it end? What exactly does it mean for a machine to learn something? 

## What is Machine Learning
Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.

Here is a slightly more general definition:
```
    [Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn 
    without being explicitly programmed.
        —Arthur Samuel, 1959
```

And a more engineering-oriented one:
```
    A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T 
    and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves 
    with experience E.
        —Tom Mitchell, 1997
```

## Why use Machine Learning
To summarize, Machine Learning is great for:

- Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform bet‐ ter.
- Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.
- Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
- Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.


## Types of Machine Learning Systems


### Supervised/Unsupervised Learning


### Batch and Online Learning


### Instance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning


## Main Challenges of Machine Learning

In short, since your main task is to select a learning algorithm and train it on some data, the two things that can go wrong are “bad algorithm” and “bad data”.

### Insufficient Quantity of Training data

### Nonrepresentative Training Data

### Poor-Quality Data

### Irrelevant Features

### Overfitting the Training Data

### Underfitting the Training Data

### Stepping Back



## Testing and Validating
